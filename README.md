## Kapton Heater System for Oxidizer Tank Pressure Regulation

This system uses a 24V, 14.6A Kapton trace heater to regulate the pressure inside a nitrous oxide oxidizer tank, particularly in colder environments where vapor pressure drops below optimal levels. The heater is PWM-controlled via a high-current N-channel MOSFET, allowing for precise thermal regulation.
